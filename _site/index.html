            <p class="description">Currently, I get to work on the Centralized Intelligent Access (CIA) team at OpenTech Alliance. In my day-to-day, I've been doing a lot of work on the frontend of our web application, mainly getting to play around with Angular and TypeScript. Lately, I've been implementing a few new features, squashing some pesky UI bugs, and paying off some tech debt (i.e. we got our app bumped up from Angular 11 to Angular 15, which was about as much fun as it sounds).</p>

            <p class="description">I worked on the portfolio engineering team. During my time there, I accomplished a number of things. For one, I wrote a preprocessing program in python to output data into text files that could be read by native code in both Windows and Linux operating systems. The reprocessing program resulted in a 80% decrease in program runtime. Additionally, I also improved the product's patch management system on Debian and Ubuntu Linux flavors. Lastly, I made contributions across the full-stack using Node.js, JavaScript, React, Python, VBScript, and SQLite.</p>

            <p class="description">I worked on both front-end and back-end teams at Relaymile. During my time, I did a number of things. First, I refactored RESTful APIs to more efficiently query database models using SQLAlchemy and Flask. Second, I improved existing React components by fixing state management conflicts and reorganizing component hierarchies. Third, I demonstronstrated understanding of modern agile development practices through participating in daily stand-up meetings, communicating with other developer and product managers, using scrum boards, and collaborating on Git and Github. Lastly, I used modern infrastructure tools, including containerized applications with Docker, Postman for API testing, and usage of Python virtual environments.</p>

However, during my time at OSU, I have enjoyed my foundational CS coursework. Relevant coursework includes Analysis of Algorithms, Data Structures, Computer Architecture and Assembly Language, Operating Systems, Web Development, Introduction to Security, Cryptography, and Open Source Software.</p>
