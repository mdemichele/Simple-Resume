title: "Mathematics for Computer Science: Why Math Matters To Me"
category: Personal Essays
---
I have always been frustrated by the utter ambiguity of mathematics in general. As someone who fell prey to the public school system's method of "teaching to the test," I was never given a comprehensive, high-level view picture of why Math mattered. Maybe it was my fault for not being curious enough to figure it out for myself, but in my math training, I never understood what the whole endeavor of mathematics was anyway. What was it even good for? And why did I have to learn it anyway?
