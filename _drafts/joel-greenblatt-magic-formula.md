title: "Notes on Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula"

This past year, I have been attempting to develop some kind of sustainable framework to guide my personal stock investment strategy. One of the first promising frameworks I stumbled upon was Joel Greenblatt's investment strategies outlined in his books *The Little Book That Beats the Market* and *You Can Be a Stock Market Genius*. Here I will attempt to summarize his thoughts in an effort to apply Greenblatt's strategies to my own personal investment portfolio. 

In the *Little Book That Beats The Market*, Greenblatt's central strategy boils down to simply following his "magic formula."  His magic formula is an investment strategy that ranks companies based on two factors:

1. Return on Capital
2. Earnings Yield

As Greenblatt explains, investing in companies with both a high Return On Capital and a high Earnings Yield will produce a return that will beat the market handily.

### Return on Capital

Return on Capital = EBIT / (Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)

EBIT stands for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. To calculate EBIT, subtract cost of goods sold and operating expenses from total revenue. 

To boil it down, EBIT can be thought of as the same as operating income. Or in other words, EBIT answers the question of how much does a business generate in income when you take away the cost of the goods or services sold and the other various costs of operation (like selling and administrative expenses). 

In a company's financial statements, EBIT can most easily be found as "operating income".  


• EBIT = Total Revenue - (cost of goods sold + operating expenses)
  • Cost of goods sold goes into the income statement. Cost of goods sold is different than cost of revenue, which is a broader category that includes more aspects of making a product salable (such as marketing costs).
  
• Net Working Capital = Total current assets - total current liabilities
• Net Fixed Assets = Gross Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation


### Earnings Yield

Earnings Yield is calculated by dividing EBIT by enterprise value.

Earnings Yield = EBIT / Enterprise value

Enterprise value is the sum of market capitalization and debt subtracted by cash and cash equivalents. 

Another way to calculate Earnings Yield is to divide the earnings per share by the share price.
