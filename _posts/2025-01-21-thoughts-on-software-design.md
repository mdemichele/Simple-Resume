This past Monday, I stumbled upon a really great article by Facundo Olano, called ["Software Design is Knowledge Building"](https://olano.dev/blog/software-design-is-knowledge-building/?curius=2181). In it, he describes the process by which a piece of software falls apart over time within an organization. He highlights some really important things in his discussion.

Reading these articles, it gives me a forest for the trees type of perspective on the industry that I've gotten myself into. It's easy to feel like you're losing ground as a software engineer. When applying for new roles, companies and especially the recruiters who find you are always obsessed with what specific technologies you know. Often, in the technical interview process, you have to demonstrate knowledge of a specific technology. I've had a number of interview questions that go something like, "build a CRUD app to store data into some kind of persistent storage." In these interviews, it doesn't look good if they ask you to build it in React and you have to look up syntax stuff because you've been working with Angular for the past two years instead of React. Sometimes, syntax doesn't stay in my brain.

But, we forget that businesses are obsessed with specific technologies because their core products are written in these specific technologies. There is a cost to maintaining these applications. The cost can be in terms of developer time spent re-learning a technology or the cost of developers not understanding a specific technology well and making mistakes in code as a result. 

But, the point is that fundamentally, software engineering is about designing systems that do something. It doesn't ultimately matter what the system is built with, so long as it performs the required operations. That's true at least from the perspective of the system. Theoretically that's true. But, software is a fundamentally human process. Humans are fallible. Humans forget. While code written 10 years ago might still do the same exact thing, the humans who are looking at the code from 10 years ago might not remember what that code is doing. 

That's the frustrating part of software engineering. I want to focus on doing interesting things. I don't want to learn a different JavaScript framework just because the company I work for decided that this is the framework we use now. But, that's inevitable at some level.

I also don't feel like a genius programmer because I don't know the ins and outs of every single technology. There's a lot more to humanness that paying attention to a particular technology.
