In the midst of the pandemic this past year, I made the long-overdue decision to finish my undergraduate degree. Although this was a necessary and thoughtfully-made decision, I didn't quite anticipate just how difficult life as an adult student would. Unlike during my first three experiences in college (yes, I've dropped out three times before), daily life now has a kind of torrential rapidity to it. Where once, as a careless eighteen year-old, my only responsibilities were school and the occasional sporting event, my time now is filled with full-time work, obligations to my partner, responsibilities to my community of friends, and, not to mention, a full load of university classes, which keep me up until those dim hours long after midnight.

Somewhere in the chaos of balancing work, family, and school, I've come to realize the unmistakable importance of managing my time, energy, and motivation wisely. I've learned, through often painful failures, that when life gets hectic, the first thing to go is my time-management. Because of this, I've developed a few simple strategies and mental heuristics for better managing my time. Although these strategies are certainly not perfect, I've found that leaning on them, especially when I'm struggling, has helped me significantly and continues to aid me in my pursuit of personal and professional progress.

# My Main Strategy 

My main strategy for keeping me on track with my time is perhaps a bit counter-intuitive. Instead of focusing primarily on planning things out or obsessively writing every task down, my strategy is to break every task down into the smallest action possible and keep a record of the small tasks I've completed.

The strategy comes directly from psychologist B.J. Fogg's ground-breaking book *Tiny Habits*. In the book, Fogg highlights the integral roles that motivation, ability, and prompt play in creating behavior change. As he explains [elsewhere](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/bj-fogg/), 
> "Information alone does not reliably lead to sustained behavior change...behavior happens when three things come together at the same moment; motivation, ability and prompt."

Following Fogg's research, I've noticed that when I focus on breaking tasks down, I end up finishing them more often. More poignantly, when I finish a task, I always feel a jolt of satisfaction, which propels forward into the rest of my tasks. This combination of making tasks easier and prioritizing feeling good about small successes gives me the components of ability and motivation that allow me to make consistent progress towards my goals. 

# Time Tracking 

Finally, I try to instill the third component of prompt by making a game of tracking both my time and my tasks. I'm not one to keep lists or to be particularly good at using calendars or planners. However, I am competitive, and I've found that I am much more motivated to write down my tasks and track my time when I treat it like a game. 

In the past, I've used apps like [TimeClockGo](https://www.timeclockgo.com/) to track my time. Being a software engineering student, I've also built numerous to-do apps and task list apps. Every day in a row that I successfully remember to use these apps, I give myself a point. Every day that I miss, I take away a point. Using this scoring system, I try to beat my high score every week and every month. 

# Conclusion 

Most of the time I don't manage to keep track of things every single day, but I've found that when I combine the elements of motivation, ability, prompt, and gamification, my progress improves significantly. 

Like the Harvard Business Review mentions in their article on [Time Management](https://hbr.org/2020/01/time-management-is-about-more-than-life-hacks), my solutions to time management never need to be perfect; they merely need to be catered to what works for me and helps me find useful life hacks in the midst of the torrential pace of everyday life.
