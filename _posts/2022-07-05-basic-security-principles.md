There are a number of important security principles that I've been taught over the past year. These principles are fundamental to both the study of cybersecurity, as well as the actual implementation of security systems. Here are a few of the principles. 

1. Always enforce least privilege. 

This is a general rule to follow.

2. Always validate inputted data to prevent against SQL injections. 

SQL injections are a form of attack where an attack can inject SQL commands into a SQL statement somewhere on the back-end of a web form. Essentially, any web application input that does a database lookup or inserts data into a database is vulnerable to these types of attacks.
